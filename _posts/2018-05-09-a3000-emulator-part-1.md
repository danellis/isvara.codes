My approach to building this emulator is to take a RISC OS 3.11 ROM image and start trying to execute it. That means I need some basic things up front: a CPU, a register file and memory, which consists of ROM, RAM and any memory-mapped devices. My source of information for these is the [Acorn RISC Machine Family Data Manual](/assets/webarc/vlsiarmbook.pdf) published by the original ARM chip fabricator, VLSI.

## CPU

The specific CPU I'm emulating is an ARM 2 from 1987. The first ARM processors were only available in development kits, so the ARM 2 was the first to be used in a commercially available computer. It's a 32-bit RISC CPU clocked at 8MHz with a 26-bit address space and 27 registers. 

## Register file

Although there are 27 registers, they're not all visible at the same time:

`R0`-`R7` and `R15` (the program counter, `PC`) are always visible, but the others depend on the processor mode. Supervisor mode is what the OS runs in. Applications run in user mode (called general in the above diagram). IRQ and FIRQ modes are entered when handling an interrupt or fast interrupt respectively. So rather than using a simple array of words, I need a function that looks at the processor mode and accesses the correct register. One other thing: the current mode and the processor status flags are stored in R15 along with the actual program counter. Remember, addresses are only 26 bits wide. All instructions are word-aligned, which means the bottom two bits can be implicitly clear, so it actually only needs to store 24 bits of address, leaving the other eight bits of the 32-bit register available for flags. That's two bits of mode, two bits of interrupt flags and four status bits.

## Memory

The memory controller, MEMC, lays out memory like this:

By treating these areas of memory differently, I'm implicitly emulating the memory controller, MEMC. Because these areas need to be treated differently, I can't use a simple array. Instead, I'm using a struct with `load` and `store` methods. These methods check the address against the boundaries above and read or write the respective areas.

## RAM

The physically mapped RAM is simple. It's just a 4 MiB array. You can write to it. You can read from it. Yawn. The logically mapped RAM is... not needed yet. Presumably it's configured by writing to MEMC's control registers, so I'll look out for that.

## ROM

Reading from ROM is simple too. It's just an array filled with the ROM image loaded from disk. Writes to that area do Other Thingsâ„¢, but I'm just calling `unimplemented!` for now, which causes a panic.

## Execution

With all that set up, I just started fetching instructions from ROM and decoding them. Whenever I hit one I didn't recognize yet, I called `unimplemented!`. First problem: the ROM starts at 0x03800000, but the processor starts executing at the reset vector, which is at 0x00000000. Turns out that MEMC initially maps ROM at 0x00000000 until an address in ROM space is accessed.

### Branches

This places the first word of ROM in the reset vector, which turns out to be a branch into real ROM space. So branches were the first instructions to be implemented. `B` for a simple branch, and `BL` for a branch-with-link, which copies `R15` to `R14` before it branches, allowing a return from a subroutine with a simple `MOVS PC, R14`. 

One of the ARM's notable features was its three-stage pipeline. At one time it would be simultaneously be executing one instruction, decoding the next and fetching the one after that. The program counter always points to the instruction being fetched, so by the time an instruction is executed, `PC` is already eight bytes (two words) ahead. I figured the easiest way to deal with that without actually having a pipeline is to keep `PC` eight bytes ahead like it should be and fetch every instruction from `PC` - 8. After each instruction executes, I increment `PC` by 4. That's fine in most cases, but after a branch, `PC` already contains the next address to fetch from. In fact, after any instruction that writes to `PC` it does, so in those cases I shouldn't be incrementing it again. Except... I actually fetch from `PC` - 8, so if `PC` is written to, I actually need to increment it by eight before I do the next fetch. To handle these different cases, I have my instruction handlers return an `Action` enum, which has members `Continue` and `Flush`. The latter simulates flushing the pipeline.

### Conditionals

The branch jumps to offset 0x1ac in ROM. What's there, though, looks a little odd:

They are not instructions. What they appear to be is some kind of pattern for testing the memory. But if it's data, how can it branch to it? I pondered that one for a while until I realized it doesn't matter that they're not instructions, because every one of them has the four most significant bits set (i.e. the hex value begins with F). All ARM instructions are conditional. They can either execute or be ignored depending on their condition code and the processor status flags. For example, an instruction with a condition code of `EQ` (equal) will only execute when the `Z` (zero) flag is set. (Comparing two values is actually a subtraction, so if they're the same the result is zero.) Most instructions have a condition code of `AL` (always). In this case, all those data words must be interpreted as instructions with the `NV` (never) condition code. That must mean that the processor checks the condition code first, and if it isn't true it doesn't bother decoding the rest of the instruction. As soon as I did the same thing to emulate that behavior, it happily skipped over all that test data until it reached the next real instruction, which happens to be `LDR` (load register).
